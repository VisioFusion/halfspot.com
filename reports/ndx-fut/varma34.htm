<td><b><i>6.4 Market Level</i></b>
<p>The group recommends:
<ol TYPE="a">
<li>
No limits should be imposed at this stage on the total market wide open
interest (as a percentage of the underlying market capitalisation).</li>

<li>
This should be reviewed at the end of six months of index futures trading
to determine whether position limits are required at this level to guard
against situations where a very large open interest leads to attempts to
manipulate the underlying market.</li>
