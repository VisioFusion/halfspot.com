<td><b><i>3.4 Margining for Calendar Spreads</i></b><b><i></i></b>
<p>The group took note of the international practice of levying very low
margins on calendar spreads. A calendar spread is a position at one maturity
which is hedged by an offsetting position at a different maturity: for
example, a short position in the six month contract coupled with a long
position in the nine month contract. The justification for low margins
is that a calendar spread is not exposed to the market risk in the underlying
at all. If the underlying rises, one leg of the spread loses money while
the other gains money resulting in a hedged position. Standard futures
pricing models state that the futures price is equal to the cash price
plus a net cost of carry (interest cost reduced by dividend yield on the
underlying). This means that the only risk in a calendar spread is the
risk that the cost of carry might change; this is essentially an interest
rate risk in a money market position. In fact, a calendar spread can be
viewed as a synthetic money market position. The above example of a short
position in the six month contract matched by a long position in the nine
month contract can be regarded as a six month future on a three month T-bill.
In developed financial markets, the cost of carry is driven by a money
market interest rate and the risk in calendar spreads is very low.
<p>In India, however, unless banks and institutions enter the calendar
spread in a big way, it is possible that the cost of carry would be driven
by an unorganised money market rate as in the case of the badla market.
These interest rates could be highly volatile. The group took on record
some results provided by Prof. Varma from his ongoing research into the
behaviour of the implicit cost of carry between markets operating on different
settlement cycles (Appendix 2).
<p>Given the evidence that the cost of carry is not an efficient money
market rate, prudence demands that the margin on calendar spreads be far
higher than international practice. Moreover, the margin system should
operate smoothly when a calendar spread is turned into a naked short or
long position on the index either by the expiry of one of the legs or by
the closing out of the position in one of the legs. The group therefore
recommends that:
<ol TYPE="a">
<li>
The margin on calendar spreads be levied at a flat rate of 0.5% per month
of spread on the far month contract of the spread subject to a minimum
margin of 1% and a maximum margin of 3% on the far side of the spread for
spreads with legs upto 1 year apart. A spread with the two legs three months
apart would thus attract a margin of 1.5% on the far month contract.</li>

<li>
The margining of calendar spreads be reviewed at the end of six months
of index futures trading.</li>

<li>
A calendar spread should be treated as a naked position in the far month
contract as the near month contract approaches expiry. This change should
be affected in gradual steps over the last few days of trading of the near
month contract. Specifically, during the last five days of trading of the
near month contract, the following percentages of a calendar spread shall
be treated as a naked position in the far month contract: 100% on day of
expiry, 80% one day before expiry, 60% two days before expiry, 40% three
days before expiry, 20% four days before expiry. The balance of the spread
shall continue to be treated as a spread. This phasing in will apply both
to margining and to the computation of exposure limits.</li>

<li>
If the closing out of one leg of a calendar spread causes the members’
liquid net worth to fall below the minimum levels specified in 4.2 below,
his terminal shall be disabled and the clearing corporation shall take
steps to liquidate sufficient positions to restore the members’ liquid
net worth to the levels mandated in 4.2.</li>

<li>
The derivatives exchange should explore the possibility that the trading
system could incorporate the ability to place a single order to buy or
sell spreads without placing two separate orders for the two legs.</li>

<li>
For the purposes of the exposure limit in 4.2 (b), a calendar spread shall
be regarded as an open position of one third of the mark to market value
of the far month contract. As the near month contract approaches expiry,
the spread shall be treated as a naked position in the far month contract
in the same manner as in 3.4 (c).</li>
