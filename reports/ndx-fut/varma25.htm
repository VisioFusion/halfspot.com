<td><b><i>5.4 Bank Accounts</i></b>
<p>The SEBI requirement of segregation of client funds could, in the futures
market, lead to a situation where a large amount of customer funds lie
in a current account which earns no interest. This is ultimately a matter
to be negotiated between the broker/exchange and the banks. The group recommends
however that the segregation rules themselves should not bar the deployment
of customer funds in liquid interest earning instruments of equivalent
safety.
