<td><b><i>5.1 Bank Guarantees</i></b>
<p>The group deliberated on the question of the acceptability of bank guarantees
in the futures market where (unlike in the cash market) banks and institutions
are themselves subject to margins. The question also arose as to whether
a bank could offer its own bank guarantee to meet the margin requirements
on its own position. This problem would arise if a bank itself became a
member of the futures exchange or if it gave a bank guarantee for a broker
through whom it has originated a large open position on its own account.
<p>The group concluded that given the Indian realities, it is necessary
to accept bank guarantees as part of the liquid net worth of the broker.
It is also of the view that a requirement that a bank cannot give its own
bank guarantee on its own behalf would be neither conceptually sound nor
easy to enforce (For example, two banks could give guarantees to each other).
<p>The group is also of the view that all banks cannot be treated alike
by the clearing corporation without regard to their net worth, capital
adequacy, credit rating and other characteristics. Considering all the
above, the group decided that the clearing corporation would set an exposure
limit for each bank taking into account all relevant factors. Specifically,
the group recommends:
<ol TYPE="a">
<li>
The Board of Directors or other equivalent organ of the clearing corporation
shall lay down exposure limits either in rupee terms or as percentage of
the trade guarantee fund that can be exposed to a single bank directly
or indirectly. The total exposure would include guarantees provided by
the bank for itself or for others as well as debt or equity securities
of the bank which have been deposited by members as liquid assets for margins
or net worth requirement.</li>

<li>
Not more than 5% of the trade guarantee fund or 1% of the total liquid
assets deposited with the clearing house whichever is lower shall be exposed
to any single bank which is not rated P1 (or P1+) or equivalent by a RBI
recognised credit rating agency and not more than 50% of the trade guarantee
fund or 10% of the total liquid assets deposited with the clearing house
whichever is lower shall be exposed to all such banks put together.</li>

<li>
The exposure limits and any changes thereto shall be promptly communicated
to SEBI. The clearing corporation shall also periodically disclose to SEBI
its actual exposure to various banks.</li>
</ol>
