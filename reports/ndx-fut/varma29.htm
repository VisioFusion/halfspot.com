<p>Suppose that on day two, the member does not initiate any new trades,
but prices move up so that the situation is as follows:

<p>The margins and exposures for the 200 contract long position would be:
<ul>
<li>
Open position = 200 * 1,01,000 = 2,02,00,000</li>

<li>
Initial Margin = 5% * 200 * 1,01,000 = 10,10,000</li>
</ul>
The spread open position for exposure purposes would be 1,41,40,000 as
calculated below since the near contract is four days to expiry:
<ul>
<li>
20% of far month = 20% * 300 * 1,01,000 = 60,60,000</li>
</ul>
<b>PLUS</b>
<ul>
<li>
80% of far month = 80% * 1/3 * 300 * 1,01,000 = 80,80,000</li>
</ul>
The initial margin on spread would be 5,45,000 as shown below:
<ul>
<li>
20% of far month = 20% * 5% * 300 * 1,01,000 = 3,03,000</li>

<li>
80% of spread = 80% * 1% * 300 * 1,01,000 = 2,42,000</li>
</ul>
The margin, exposure and liquid networth of the member would be as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Total open position = 2,02,00,000 + 1,41,40,000 = 3,43,40,000</li>

<li>
Total initial margin = 10,10,000 + 5,45,400 = 15,55,400</li>

<li>
Liquid net worth = 70,00,000 - 15,55,400 = 54,44,600</li>
</ul>
Both conditions in 4.2 above are satisfied as shown below:
<p>Condition 1. 54,44,600 > 50,00,000
<p>2. 54,44,600 * 33<sup>1/3</sup> (18,14,86,667) > 3,43,40,000
