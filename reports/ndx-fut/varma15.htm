<td><b><i>3.3 Daily Changes in Margins</i></b>
<p>The group recommends that the volatility estimated at the end of the
day’s trading would be used in calculating margin calls at the end of the
same day. This implies that during the course of trading, market participants
would not know the exact margin that would apply to their position. It
was agreed therefore that the volatility estimation and margin fixation
methodology would be clearly made known to all market participants so that
they can compute what the margin would be for any given closing level of
the index. It was also agreed that the trading software would itself provide
this information on a real time basis on the trading workstation screen.
