<td><b><font size=+1>9. Risk containment in cash market</font></b>
<p>The group recognises that it is easier to introduce stringent risk containment
measures in the derivatives market which are being set up from scratch.
However, it does not make sense to have laxer risk containment measures
in the cash market than in the derivatives market. The group recommends
that the basic ideas enshrined in this report be extended to the cash market.
In particular:
<ol TYPE="a">
<li>
the margins in the cash market should be based on a 99% VaR. As an interim
measure, the margins could be twice that in the index futures market since
individual securities are roughly twice as volatile as the index. Exposure
limits could also be commensurately lower than in the derivatives market.</li>

<li>
the recommendations on the computation of liquid net worth and the up front
margins could be readily applied to the cash market.</li>
</ol>
