<b><i>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trader Net Worth</i></b>
<blockquote>Even an accurate 99% "value at risk" model would give rise
to end of day mark to market losses exceeding the margin approximately
once every six months. Trader networth provides an additional level of
safety to the market and works as a deterrent to the incidence of defaults.
A member with high networth would try harder to avoid defaults as his own
networth would be at stake. The definition of networth needs to be made
precise having regard to prevailing accounting practices and laws.
