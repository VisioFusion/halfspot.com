<td><b><i>3.2 Initial Margin Fixation Methodology</i></b>
<p>The group took on record the estimation and backtesting results provided
by Prof. Varma (see Appendix 1) from his ongoing research work on value
at risk calculations in Indian financial markets. The group, being satisfied
with these backtesting results, recommends the following margin fixation
methodology as the initial methodology for the purposes of 3.1.1 above.
<ol TYPE="a">
<li>
The exponential moving average method would be used to obtain the volatility
estimate every day. The estimate at the end of day t, <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>t</sub>
is estimated using the previous volatility estimate <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>t-1</sub>
(as at the end of day t-1),and the return r<sub>t</sub> observed in the
futures market during day t.</li>

<br>(<font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>t</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = <font face="Symbol">l</font>
(<font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>t-1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (1 - <font face="Symbol">l</font>
) (r<sub>t</sub>)<sup>2</sup>
<p>where <font face="Symbol">l</font> is a parameter which determines how
rapidly volatility estimates change.
<li>
A value of 0.94 would be used for <font face="Symbol">l</font> .</li>

<li>
The margins for 99% VAR would be based on three sigma limits.</li>

<li>
For statistical reasons, return is defined as the logarithmic return</li>

<br>r<sub>t</sub> = ln(I<sub>t</sub>/I<sub>t-1</sub>)
<br>where I<sub>t</sub> is the index futures price at time t.
<li>
Given this statistical definition, the plus/minus three sigma limits for
a 99% VAR would specify the maximum/minimum likely logarithmic returns.
To convert these into percentage margins, the logarithmic returns would
have to be converted into percentage price changes by reversing the logarithmic
transformation. Therefore the percentage margin on short positions would
be equal to 100(exp(3<font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>t</sub>)-1) and the
percentage margin on long positions would be equal to 100(1-exp(-3<font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>t</sub>)).
This implies slightly larger margins on short positions than on long positions,
but the difference is not significant except during periods of high volatility
where the difference merely reflects the fact that the downside is limited
(prices can at most fall to zero) while the upside is unlimited. The derivatives
exchange/clearing corporation may, if it so chooses, simply apply the higher
margin on both the buy and sell side.</li>

<li>
To use the formula in (a) above on the first day of index futures trading
would require a value of <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>t-1</sub> , the
estimated volatility at the end of the day preceding the first day of index
futures trading. This would be obtained as follows. (i) Calculate the standard
deviation of returns in the cash index during the last one year. (ii) Set
the volatility estimate at the beginning of that year equal to this average
value. (iii) Move forward through the year, one day at a time, using the
formula in (a) above to get the estimated volatility at the end of that
day using cash index prices instead of index future prices. (iv) The estimated
volatility by this method at the end of the day preceding the first day
of index futures trading would be the value of <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>t-1</sub>
to be used in formula in (a) above at the end of the first day of futures
trading. Thereafter each day’s estimate <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>t</sub>
become the <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>t-1</sub> for the next day.</li>

<li>
As a transitional measure, for the first six months of trading (until the
futures market stabilises with a reasonable level of trading), a parallel
estimation of volatility would be done using the cash index prices instead
of the index futures prices and the higher of the two volatility measures
would be used to set margins.</li>

<li>
As a further transitional measure, for the first six months of trading
(until the futures market stabilises with a reasonable level of trading),
the initial margin shall not be less than 5%.</li>
</ol>
In the initial period, margins for futures market would be set using volatility
derived from the cash market as discussed in (f) above. This involves an
assumption that the volatility of the Nifty or Sensex futures would be
identical to the volatility of the same index in the cash market. However,
the volatility in the futures market could be higher because of "noise
trader risk". The group is of the view that this is not a serious problem
because of the use of the exponential moving average method to estimate
volatility. This method is more sensitive to recent data, the weightage
attached to volatility figures derived from the cash market declines rapidly
as data from the futures markets itself becomes available. Therefore if
futures markets do turn out to be more volatile, the margins would adjust
upwards very quickly. Moreover, the transitional measures outlined in (g)
and (h) above provide a further degree of protection.
