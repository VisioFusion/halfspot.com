<td><b><i>2.2 Calendar spreads</i></b>
<blockquote>In developed markets, calendar spreads are essentially a play
on interest rates with negligible stock market exposure. As such margins
for calendar spreads are very low. However, in India,&nbsp; the calendar
basis risk could be high because of the absence of efficient index arbitrage
and the&nbsp; lack of channels for the flow of funds from the organised
money market into the index future market.</blockquote>
