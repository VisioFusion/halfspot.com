<td><b>3.1.3 Continuous Refining</b>
<p>The derivatives exchange and clearing corporation should be encouraged
to refine this methodology continuously on the basis of further experience.
Any proposal for changes in the methodology should be filed with SEBI and
released to the public for comments along with detailed comparative backtesting
results of the proposed methodology and the current methodology. The proposal
shall specify the date from which the new methodology will become effective
and this effective date shall not be less than three months after the date
of filing with SEBI. At any time up to two weeks before the effective date,
SEBI may instruct the derivatives exchange and clearing corporation not
to implement the change, or the derivatives exchange and clearing corporation
may on its own decide not to implement the change.
