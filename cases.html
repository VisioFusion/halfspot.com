           Event Date: 2021</i><br>
        In March 2021, Nayan Parikh &amp; Consultants (NPC) has to decide how to recover the loan that it had extended to Shrenikbhai Vimawala, Chairman and Managing Director, Shrenik Limited against a pledge of Shrenik shares. When NPC granted the loan to Vimawala a year earlier, it was to be paid back within 3 months. But, immediately after disbursing the loan, the Covid-19 pandemic caused a severe disruption of economic activities in India and Shrenik also faced financial difficulties. In view of this, NPC provided multiple extensions of time to Vimawala.  But in March 2021, the pandemic had abated in India, the economy was on the recovery path, and NPC was concerned about recovering its dues. Shrenik's stock price had fallen sharply and its financial situation had deteriorated considerably.

        The non-executive Chairman, Chaturvedi, has to provide leadership to the Board of Directors of ICICI Bank as it deals with the adverse findings by a former Supreme Court judge against Ms. Chanda Kochhar, the former Chief Executive of the Bank.  She had not disclosed a conflict of interest regarding a loan to a corporate group that had dealings with her husband. Months earlier the Board had exonerated her and also allowed her to retire from the Bank. Could and should the Board now reclassify Kochhar’s retirement as ‘Termination for Cause’  and claw back her past bonuses?

        The case introduces three different startup contexts where the financing proposals involve instruments with certain unique features. The caselets narrate the difficulties that arise in the early-stage financing of firms and offer an opportunity to discuss how appropriate financing structures act as mitigants. The financing structures cover, staged VC financing, participating preference shares, financing with anti-dilution clauses, and convertible notes.

        <i>Case written in 2021 Geography: India 
           Event Date: 2008</i><br>
        Northern Textiles (NTL) used highly complex derivatives to hedge its currency risk, and these structured products have been profitable in the past. But in 2008, unanticipated movements in exchange rates have led to serious losses. Seth, the Chairman of NTL, has come to know about the losses on a specific deal, but the Treasurer has ensured that he is the only person who understands the derivative book in its entirety. Though Seth is not aware of how grave the problem is, he realizes that he must review NTL's risk management policies and perhaps even replace the CFO.

           Event Date: 2008</i><br>
        NTL suffered huge losses in its foreign exchange hedging activities as its highly complex leveraged structured products backfired badly in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007 and 2008. The CFO and the Treasury head have both been sacked, and Joshi, the new CFO, has embraced aggressive litigation as NTL’s survival strategy to cope with the losses that threaten its solvency. In the meantime, NTL also faces tax investigations and whistleblower allegations of fraud, and it finds that the record-keeping of its derivative transactions was hopelessly incomplete and patchy. A complete reconstruction of the entire derivative transaction history is the only way to rebuild trust, and that task falls on Reddy, a seasoned derivatives expert brought in by the Board specifically for this purpose. In this dire situation, Seth, the founder Chairman of NTL decides that NTL needs to put all this behind it and focus on rebuilding the business. The challenge for Seth, Joshi and Reddy is to go about doing this in an environment that offers very few rays of hope.

        <i>Case written in 2021 Geography: India 
           Event Date: 2017</i><br>
        The case describes the change in fortune of Reliance Communications (RCom) from being a pioneer in offering low-cost mobile telephony to the brink of bankruptcy. After giving a brief background on the family history of Reliance Industries, its break-up and the launch of RCom, it describes the changing dynamics of the Indian telecommunications industry after the launch of Reliance Jio and the difficulties faced by RCom. As RCom's debt troubles increased, while its stock price and its credit rating plunged, yields on its Indian Rupee bonds barely moved. The case allows for discussing ways of implementing capital structure arbitrage in such situations and analyze issues that arise in doing so. The case provides data on yields on RCom's Indian Rupee and US dollar bonds over time and provides additional relevant financial information about RCom, including its market share, stock price, credit rating and balance sheet variables. The case would be appropriate for use in an advanced corporate finance or a strategic risk management or a trading strategies course.

        <i>Case written in 2020 Geography: India

        When Prime Broking defaulted on its equity derivative positions at the National Stock Exchange, the central counterparty (CCP) suffered substantial losses, although there was no significant movement in the relevant market prices. This revealed hidden risks arising from collateral, liquidity and concentration, wrong-way risks and operational risks in the default management process, even when the market risk environment is benign. The CCP ends up with risks it is not designed to handle and similar to those faced by a bank. The CCP suffered massive losses, even though its market risk models functioned flawlessly.

        In November 2017, Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, the founders of Tezos, confronted a governance crisis that threatened to destroy their project and expose them to serious legal risks. All developmental activities in Tezos were stalled after Breitmans lost access to the funds raised through an initial coin offering (ICO) four months earlier. Moreover, a series of class-action lawsuits in the United States alleged that the USD 230 million ICO of July was an illegal security offering. The case provides a fascinating situation for discussions on the principles and the frameworks for governance.

        The case is about a decision problem facing James on whether or not to invest in a structured product called the "CMS Steepener" issued by a large US investment bank. The payoff from the product is linked to two constant maturity swap (CMS) rates, and the investor profits if the difference between the two CMS rates increases, or alternatively if the CMS curve steepens. The case describes the risks that investing in such a product poses, and presents relevant data on the CMS rates, term structure and recent financial history of the issuer to help resolve James’s decision problem.

      <dd>
        <i>Case written in 2016 Geography: United States 
           Event Date: 2014</i><br>
        This case is about the practical and conceptual issues involved in estimating the beta of a company for the purpose of computing the cost of capital using the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model). In many applications of the CAPM in the classroom, the beta is assumed to be known or is exogenously specified. This case is an opportunity to confront the fact that, in the real world, the beta has to be estimated and there is often a wide range of uncertainty (confidence interval) around any point estimate of the beta. The issue that Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Judge Travis Laster needed to resolve in October 2014 was that the beta estimated by the plaintiff and the defendant varied so substantially that they implied a difference of over $100 million in the valuation of Rural-Metro. The case provides a live context to discuss conceptual and statistical issues that are often glossed over as minor details of the estimation process. In the real world, these apparently minor details make a big difference to the results and can no longer be ignored. In an advanced course, the case also provides an opportunity to expose the participants to the large academic literature on beta estimation.

           Event Date: 2015</i><br>
        In September, 2011, to prevent its currency from appreciating after the Global Financial Crisi, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) decided to peg its currency to EUR and announced that it would not let CHF go beyond 1/1.20 EUR. Maintaining the peg required the SNB to purchase foreign currency assests virtually endlessly in response to the worsening Eurozone crisis. By end of 2014, its foreign currency exchange reserves amounted to alomst 80% of its GDP. In an attempt to deter capital flows and reduce its balance sheet size, in December, 2014, the SNB first brought the interest rate on commerical bank deposits to negative levels and then, facing impending quantitative easing by the Europeon Central Bank, announced the removal of the peg on January 15, 2015. The case describes the backdrop and the circumstances leading up to removal of the peg.

           Event Date: 2015</i><br>
        In the aftermath of global financial crisis of 2008 and the ensuing capital flows into Switzerland, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) decided to peg Swiss Franc (CHF) to the Euro (EUR), and announced that it would not let CHF go beyond 1.20 starting 6 September, 2011. With ever-increasing capital flows, maintaining the peg required the SNB to purchase foreign currency assets almost endlessly, and by the end of 2014 its foreign exchange reserves stood at almost 80% of its Gross Domestic Product. With the European Central Bank announcing its “quantitative easing” program from 2015, and faced with the prospect of a massive balance sheet, SNB finally decided to discontinue the peg starting January 15, 2015. Immediately after the peg was removed, the CHF surged by almost 30% to EUR and this left many market participants stranded with losses worth hundreds of millions of dollars. This case describes the market turmoil and the main casualties after the peg was discontinued, with a focus on one particular retail foreign exchange (FX) brokerage firm, FXCM Inc., which was left with a negative equity of almost $300 million after removal of the peg.

        The case focuses on the key choices and decision issues that entrepreneurs face in the fast evolving mode of startup funding, known as crowdfunding. It is centred around three products which vary significantly on many dimensions such as the level of innovativeness, risk, social good generated by the product, and the target group. The products presented facilitate rich discussion on the key crowdfunding decisions such as relative merits of angel funding and crowdfunding, choice of the crowdfunding platform, nature of campaign, target amount and reward structure. The case highlights financing issues of startups and compare the two products  in their attractiveness for reward crowdfunding.

           Event Date: 2014</i><br>
        After the global financial crisis of 2008, Allied Irish Banks (AIB) was rescued by the Irish government. During 2013 and 2014, the tiny fraction of shares remaining with the public appeared to be vastly overvalued in the Irish stock market. The American Depository Receipts (ADRs) of AIB appeared to be overvalued even relative to the inflated Irish price. The case illustrates the possibility of pervasive mispricing in an illiquid market and the difficulty of valuing companies with large embedded option values.

        This case brings together four incidents of market manipulation and regulatory violations in different organizations in India and the UK. It highlights the importance of regulatory compliance and ethics in financial organizations. Principles-based regulation is more flexible but can be ambiguous and uncertain. Rules-based regulation has the advantage of clarity and certainty but encourages regulatees to find loopholes in the law.  The case illustrates the differences between rules-based and principles-based regulation and the role of the appellate process. It also points to the risks involved in pursuing strategies that are not explicitly prohibited by law but would be perceived as unfair or inappropriate
